# figure 1: how did we get poses
# axis: x-axis: t, y-axis: angles
def figure_1():
    pass

# figure 2: definitions of measures
# axis: x-axis p, y-axis matrix error
# draw for one subject for section two
# draw matrix error, and optimal error
# in PPT: mark b_global (min), b_local(area), b_sequence (area between)

# figure 3: what is matrix error
# axis: x-axis p, y-axis matrix error
# draw for all subjects (not average) for section 2


# figure 4: what is matrix error
# axis: x-axis p, y-axis matrix error
# draw average over participants, for all sections


# figure 5: how did we compute slopes
# axis: x-axis sessions 2-8, y-axis: for each measure X6
# draw for one subject (highest R^2), points and slope


# === data analysis ====

# figure 6: measures' histograms
# 6 X 4 subplots
# each row is a section (1, 2, overline, 9)
# each column is a measure
# each subplot is a histogram of that measure


# figure 7: measures' correlation
# matrix/table: 24 X 24 (all measure X all measures
# Value is R, but only if p<0.05



# === internal insights ===
# figure 8: do participants who explore more learn more with time
# formula: (\delta^i | \tilde\delta) ~ matrix^i + i + (n_pose^i | b_...)


# === external validation ===
# formula '(CEI | BFI | PET) ~ factor(measures)'

# ad_hoc (figure 7) ==> 3 measures
